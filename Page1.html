    <h1>About Me</h1>
    </p> <br>
    <p>My name is Kevin Hill. I founded Middle Mountain Productions back in 2018. I had spent years taking photos and
        making videos until one day I had people constantly reaching out for senior photos. <br>
        I began doing freelance photography before I began working for a Ski Resort in the marketing department. I
        focused on visual marketing for the ski reort, making daily snow report videos, an posting <br>
        photos to all of the social media and the website! As skiers and riders continued to meet me throughout the
        years, many reached out for videos and photos of them skiing and riding, <br>
        which is where Middle Mountain Productions was born. <br>
        I travel the country to help you capture you favorite memories in photographs and in videos. Please contact
        me so I can assist you in purchasing the right package option that will suit you needs!</p></div>
